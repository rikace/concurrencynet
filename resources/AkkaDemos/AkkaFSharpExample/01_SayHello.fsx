// #Using Actor
// Actors are one of Akka's concurrent models.
// An Actor is a like a thread instance with a mailbox. 
// It can be created with system.ActorOf: use receive to get a message, and <! to send a message.
// This example is an EchoServer which can receive messages then print them.

// An ActorSystem is a reference to the underlying system and Akka.NET framework. 
// All actors live within the context of this actor system
