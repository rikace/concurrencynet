(*This is a simple implementation of an object pool using an agent (MailboxProcessor). 
The pool is created with an initial number of object using the specified generator. 
The ObjectPool has three functions: Put: An item can be 'Put' into the pool. 
Get: An item can be taken from the pool ToListAndClear: 
A list of all the items in the pool is returned and the pool is cleared.*)
